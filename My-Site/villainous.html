            <h2>Villainous</h2>
            <p>Villainous is a strategy board game where players take on the roles of iconic Disney villains, each with unique abilities and objectives. The game features asymmetric gameplay, meaning every villain has a distinct goal, from Maleficent cursing locations to Captain Hook defeating Peter Pan. Players move their villain across their personal board, collecting power, playing allies and effects, and dealing with Fate cards, which introduce heroes that hinder their progress. Strategic planning and interference with opponents are key to victory, as players must balance progressing their own objectives while disrupting others. With expansions introducing new villains and playstyles, Villainous offers deep strategy, engaging interactions, and endless replayability for Disney and board game fans alike.</p>
